## 10/8/2025 - Part Sourcing and Identification  


From the outset, I was pretty set on doing a vertical spinner approach to the weapon, so I went straight into part sourcing.

I worked on doing research to find optimal components to complete a competitive battlebot.

I'll break it down into categories, all focusing on being competitive, while also cost-efficient.

**Drive motors:**
N10 (if possible), are much lighter, and sometimes more powerful. Ordering from a reputable supplier will make a **HUGE** difference, I think BBB sells pretty competitive ones, at good prices. Aliexpress versions have a **VERY** low stall current.

**Controller:**
The pretty obvious choice is the Malenki Nano, which will be sourced from the same location as above.

I'll get to doing the weapon motor, and other components tomorrow.
  

## 10/18/2025 - Started on Chassis  

Based on that research, I moved onto the creation of the chassis.

In terms of the wheels, I was inspired by this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSwuph2TElI), and really wanted to have a go at casting custom wheels.



I came up with this wheel design, having a 25mm OD, with a press-fit 3mm D-Shaft for linking to the N10 motor. This is what it all looks like when it's assembled.

I also plan to source a dye for these wheels, to enhance the colour scheme of the robot.

I then worked on integrating that into a chassis.

I thought it'd be very important to have adequate protection on the wheels, so I added in some thick guards around them. The chassis will be printed from a PP filament.

It is 140mm in length at the moment.
  

## 10/21/2025 - Chassis Additions  

Moving on from the base of the chassis that I created a few days ago, I wanted to add the following:

- Front wedges.
- Blade Cutout

To create a wedge effect at the front, I added thin struts that come off the main body, with then a thin piece of titanium sheet on the front.

I also added a small angle across the whole back face, which I think should help the combat performance.

## 10/26/2025 5 PM - Blade Developement  

I firstly started by working on the overall blade shape, from which I drew inspiration from other vertical spinners that have had success.

Above is my first (balanced) weapon, but I didn't quite like the tooth size.

In the next version I fixed that.

The following report from Solidworks shows that it's very balanced.

When cut from Titanium at PCBWay, it'll weigh 24g.

It'll be coupled with a 2207 motor.

In the end... I decided I didn't quite like the blade, and redid it again :), changing the location of the counterbalance.

## 10/26/2025 7 PM - Weapon Motor Mounting  

I also added the mount for the 2207 - with the option to become 2204.5 if weight is an issue.

To do this, I used 2, 2mm carbon fibre plates, which are then pocketed to allow for more weight to be allocated into the weapon system.

The shaft of the motor will be turned down, and then will fit into a 5mm ID flanged bearing.

This is how it's looking so far.  

## 11/9/2025 - Top Plate  

Today I worked on the integration of a top plate into the design, which will protect the electronics inside.

I also furthered work on the chassis 3D print, and the weapon mounts.
