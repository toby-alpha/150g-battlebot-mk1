This is my journal of the design and building process of **150g Antweight Battlebot**.

## 10/8/2025 - Part Sourcing and Identification  


From the outset, I was pretty set on doing a vertical spinner approach to the weapon, so I went straight into part sourcing.

I worked on doing research to find optimal components to complete a competitive battlebot.

I'll break it down into categories, all focusing on being competitive, while also cost-efficient.

**Drive motors:**
N10 (if possible), are much lighter, and sometimes more powerful. Ordering from a reputable supplier will make a **HUGE** difference, I think BBB sells pretty competitive ones, at good prices. Aliexpress versions have a **VERY** low stall current.

**Controller:**
The pretty obvious choice is the Malenki Nano, which will be sourced from the same location as above.

I'll get to doing the weapon motor, and other components tomorrow.
  

## 10/18/2025 - Started on Chassis  

Based on that research, I moved onto the creation of the chassis.

In terms of the wheels, I was inspired by this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSwuph2TElI), and really wanted to have a go at casting custom wheels.



I came up with this wheel design, having a 25mm OD, with a press-fit 3mm D-Shaft for linking to the N10 motor. This is what it all looks like when it's assembled.

I also plan to source a dye for these wheels, to enhance the colour scheme of the robot.

I then worked on integrating that into a chassis.

I thought it'd be very important to have adequate protection on the wheels, so I added in some thick guards around them. The chassis will be printed from a PP filament.

It is 140mm in length at the moment.
