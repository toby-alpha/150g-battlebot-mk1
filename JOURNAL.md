## 10/8/2025 - Part Sourcing and Identification  


From the outset, I was pretty set on doing a vertical spinner approach to the weapon, so I went straight into part sourcing.

I worked on doing research to find optimal components to complete a competitive battlebot.

I'll break it down into categories, all focusing on being competitive, while also cost-efficient.

**Drive motors:**
N10 (if possible), are much lighter, and sometimes more powerful. Ordering from a reputable supplier will make a **HUGE** difference, I think BBB sells pretty competitive ones, at good prices. Aliexpress versions have a **VERY** low stall current.

**Controller:**
The pretty obvious choice is the Malenki Nano, which will be sourced from the same location as above.

I'll get to doing the weapon motor, and other components tomorrow.
